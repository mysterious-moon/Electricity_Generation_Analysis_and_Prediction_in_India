# Electricity_Generation_Analysis_and_Prediction_in_India
This project uses regression analysis to study electricity generation across regions over the past three years. It models the impact of various energy sources—thermal, hydro and nuclear—and predicts future output. The goal is to support energy planning through accurate, data-driven forecasting.
