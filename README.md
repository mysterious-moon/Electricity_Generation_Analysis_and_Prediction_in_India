# Electricity_Generation_Analysis_and_Prediction_in_India
This regression-based analytical project focuses on modeling and forecasting regional electricity generation in a national context over the past three years. The study aims to identify patterns and quantify the contribution of various energy generation techniques—including thermal, hydroelectric and nuclear—across different geographic regions. By leveraging historical generation data, the project applies multiple regression techniques to evaluate temporal trends, regional disparities, and the impact of energy source composition on total power output.

Key objectives include the development of predictive models to estimate future electricity generation based on the type and distribution of energy sources employed in each region. The analysis incorporates feature engineering, data normalization, and correlation analysis to improve model accuracy and interpretability.

The findings of this project aim to support strategic energy planning and policy-making by providing data-driven insights into the efficiency and reliability of different power generation methods. Ultimately, the model serves as a decision-support tool for forecasting energy supply and guiding investment in sustainable and regionally appropriate energy infrastructure.

# Overview of India's Electricity Sector

## Position in Global Context
- **Third Largest Producer**: India ranks as the world's third largest producer of electricity.
- **Third Largest Consumer**: It is also the third largest consumer of electricity globally.

## Electricity Generation Breakdown  
- **Sources of Generation**:  
  - **Thermal Power Plants**: **65%** of electricity consumed.  
  - **Hydroelectric Power Plants**: **22%** of electricity generated.  
  - **Nuclear Power Plants**: **3%** contribution to the electricity supply.  
  - **Other Renewable Sources**: **10%** from alternatives like solar, wind, and biomass.  
  
- **Coal Reserves**: About **53.7%** of India’s commercial energy demand is fulfilled by its extensive coal reserves.  

## Growth Trajectory  
- **Electricity Generation Increase**:  
  - From **179 TW-hr in 1985** to **1,057 TW-hr in 2012**.  
  - The increase is chiefly attributed to coal-fired plants and renewable energy sources.  
  
- **Trends from 2012-2017**:  
  - Growth in contributions from natural gas, oil, and hydro plants declined.  
  - Renewable energy sources contributed nearly **20%** of the total in 2017.  

## Recent Developments  
- In the **2019-20** period, all incremental electricity generation came solely from renewable energy sources, reflecting a decrease in fossil fuel generation.   

## Government Initiatives  
- The Indian government is actively striving to boost investments in renewable energy to diversify the energy mix and reduce the reliance on coal.
